This project is basically just me learning Google Charts and kinda-sorta
attempting to write JavaScript for the first time in years.  Which is why
most of the processing code is in Python.

While parts are general, much of it is specific to survey data for a recent
Grand Comics Database.  It is likely not of general use- in particular, I am
no doubt still missing things about Google Charts, some of which may
make some of the code unnecessary.

If you somehow landed here looking for generic tools, you probably want to
look somewhere else.
