    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>
      This document is the summary report for the first user
      survey conducted by the Grand Comics Database (GCD).  The goal
      of this survey was to get a basic reading on who visits the
      GCD, why they visit, how involved they are with the community,
      and a very general sense of how much they like the site.
    </p>
    <p>
      In particular, the survey aimed to give a voice to the suspected
      large majority of visitors who are not active on the organization's
      mailing lists or Facebook group.
    </p>
    <h2>Caveats</h2>
    <p>
      This survey measures visitors who felt motivated to complete a survey
      in English within a fairly short window during which it was open.
      This may over- or under-represent various populations.
      The language barrier is the most obvious, but for instance we are
      probably seeing fewer respondents who prefer other sites to the GCD
      simply because such visitors likely do not come here regularly.
    </p>
    <h2>Summary of Results</h2>
    <ul>
      <li> Nearly 70% of respondents do not follow or post to any mailing
           lists or social media channel.
      <li> Less than 10% actively post to either the lists or Facebook.
      <li> Most GCD visitors prefer the GCD over other sites, although
           a substantial minority use the GCD and other sites about
           equally.
      <li> Nearly all (98%) of our visitors are male.
      <li> The majority are middle-aged (between 40 and 69).
      <li> Nearly everyone who used the open comment box to ask for an
           improvement asked for something related to search.
      <li> Very few GCD users are only interested in recent comics,
           and a few comments noted the GCD's weakness in this area.
    </ul>
    <p>Insights TBD</p>

    <h2>Geographic Statistics</h2>
    <p>
      I created several regions to prevent a lot of tiny slices while
      grouping things geographically.  Australia and New Zealand are
      grouped with the one respondent each from South Korea and the
      Philipines who both listed English as their only language.  I've
      labeled this the "Pacific Anglophone" region.
    <p>
      The other regions are what you would expect, with the three
      largest country populations (U.S., U.K., and Canada) standing
      on their own.  Note that there is only one respondent in the
      "North Africa" region, an active indexer in Libya who indexes
      comics in Arabic.  Unlike with the Pacific Anglophone grouping,
      I decided not to put him in with Europe due to the language
      difference.  There were no other respondents from Africa or Asia.
    <p>
      <strong>Note:</strong> You can see the values as percentages by
      hovering over the pie slices.

    <h2>Detailed Results</h2>
    <h2>Gender</h2>
    <p class="side_text">
      Somewhat unsurprisingly, the majority of the GCD's audience consists
      of middle-aged men.  What is surprising is that the audience is not
      just majority male, but almost entirely male.  This holds true in
      similar proportiong across nearly all significant-size user groups.
    <div id="gender" class="inline_chart"></div>
    <p class="side_text">
      The one exception is that women make up a very slightly larger
      percentage of those who come to the GCD to research for writing
      about comics.  However, the sample size is so small that one really
      cannot draw significant conclusions from that.

    <h3>Age</h3>
    <h3>Community</h3>
    <p>
      The GCD conducts it's organizational business through several
      mailing lists.  Additionally, the GCD's Facebook group provides
      an alternative and generally less formal communication channel.
